# Medium Complexity Project Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Universal AI Development System to create a medium complexity web application with both frontend and backend components.

## Project Description

```
I want to create a recipe sharing platform where users can create accounts, post their favorite recipes with ingredients and instructions, search for recipes by ingredients or categories, and save recipes to their favorites. The application should have a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
```

## Expected Initialization Process

When the AI agent processes this project description, it should:

1. Determine that this is a fullstack project requiring both frontend and backend
2. Select the fullstack workflow
3. Create a Memory Bank with project details
4. Set up the project structure for both frontend and backend
5. Configure Git and MCP servers
6. Generate a detailed to-do list covering both frontend and backend tasks
7. Select an appropriate technology stack (e.g., React for frontend, Node.js/Express for backend, MongoDB for database)
8. Initialize the project with necessary dependencies
9. Create initial code files for both frontend and backend
10. Begin implementing features according to the workflow

## Expected Development Process

The AI agent should:

### Backend Development
1. Set up database models for users, recipes, categories
2. Implement user authentication and authorization
3. Create API endpoints for recipe CRUD operations
4. Implement search functionality
5. Add favorites functionality
6. Write tests for all API endpoints

### Frontend Development
1. Create responsive UI components
2. Implement user registration and login
3. Build recipe creation and editing forms
4. Develop recipe browsing and search interface
5. Add favorites management
6. Implement responsive design
7. Write tests for all components

### Integration and Deployment
1. Connect frontend to backend API
2. Test end-to-end functionality
3. Optimize performance
4. Deploy both frontend and backend
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Testing This Example

To test this example:

1. Copy the project description to `core/init/project_description.md`
2. Run Cursor and activate the AI agent with Yolo mode
3. Execute the initialization command: `Initialize project based on project_description.md`
4. Observe how the AI agent follows the workflow and implements the application
5. Verify that the AI agent checks the Memory Bank before each action
6. Confirm that the to-do list is updated as tasks are completed
7. Ensure that both frontend and backend components are properly developed and integrated
