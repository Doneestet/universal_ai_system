# Simple Project Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Universal AI Development System to create a simple web application.

## Project Description

```
I want to create a simple web application that allows users to create and manage a to-do list. 
The application should allow users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
```

## Expected Initialization Process

When the AI agent processes this project description, it should:

1. Determine that this is a frontend or fullstack project
2. Select the appropriate workflow
3. Create a Memory Bank with project details
4. Set up the project structure
5. Configure Git and MCP servers
6. Generate a detailed to-do list
7. Select an appropriate technology stack (e.g., React, Vue, or Angular for frontend)
8. Initialize the project with necessary dependencies
9. Create initial code files
10. Begin implementing features according to the workflow

## Expected Development Process

The AI agent should:

1. Implement the UI components for the to-do list
2. Add functionality for adding, editing, and deleting tasks
3. Implement task completion functionality
4. Add data persistence (local storage or backend)
5. Style the application for good user experience
6. Write tests for all functionality
7. Deploy the application

## Testing This Example

To test this example:

1. Copy the project description to `core/init/project_description.md`
2. Run Cursor and activate the AI agent with Yolo mode
3. Execute the initialization command: `Initialize project based on project_description.md`
4. Observe how the AI agent follows the workflow and implements the application
5. Verify that the AI agent checks the Memory Bank before each action
6. Confirm that the to-do list is updated as tasks are completed
