# Deployment Instructions

This document provides detailed instructions for the AI agent on how to deploy a project using the Universal AI Development System.

## Deployment Philosophy

Deployment is the process of making the application available to users. A good deployment process should be:

1. Automated - to minimize human error and ensure consistency
2. Repeatable - to allow for reliable deployments across environments
3. Monitored - to quickly identify and resolve issues
4. Secure - to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access
5. Reversible - to allow for quick rollbacks if issues are discovered

Always check the Memory Bank before performing any deployment tasks to understand the current context and requirements.

## Deployment Preparation

Before deploying the application:

1. Ensure all tests pass in the testing environment.

2. Verify that all features meet the acceptance criteria.

3. Optimize the application for production:
   - Minify and bundle frontend assets
   - Remove development dependencies
   - Configure proper environment variables
   - Optimize database indexes and queries

4. Perform a security audit to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.

5. Update documentation to reflect the current state of the application.

6. Create a deployment plan that includes:
   - Deployment steps
   - Rollback procedures
   - Verification steps
   - Communication plan

## CI/CD Pipeline Setup

To automate the deployment process:

1. Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that:
   - Runs on every code push
   - Builds the application
   - Runs tests
   - Performs static code analysis
   - Generates deployment artifacts

2. Set up a continuous deployment (CD) pipeline that:
   - Deploys the application to the appropriate environment
   - Runs smoke tests after deployment
   - Notifies the team of deployment status
   - Enables easy rollbacks

3. Configure environment-specific settings for:
   - Development
   - Testing/Staging
   - Production

4. Set up proper access controls for the CI/CD pipeline.

5. Configure secrets management to securely handle sensitive information.

## Frontend Deployment

For deploying frontend applications:

1. Build the application for production:
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Enable code splitting
   - Configure proper caching headers
   - Set up content delivery network (CDN) if appropriate

2. Deploy static assets to a hosting service such as:
   - Netlify
   - Vercel
   - AWS S3 + CloudFront
   - GitHub Pages

3. Configure custom domain and SSL certificate.

4. Set up proper caching strategies for static assets.

5. Implement a content security policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks.

6. Configure monitoring and analytics.

## Backend Deployment

For deploying backend applications:

1. Choose the appropriate hosting platform based on requirements:
   - Containerized solutions (Docker + Kubernetes)
   - Platform as a Service (Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
   - Serverless (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)
   - Traditional VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS EC2)

2. Configure the production database:
   - Set up proper indexing
   - Configure backups
   - Set up replication if needed
   - Optimize for performance

3. Set up proper logging and monitoring:
   - Application logs
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring
   - Alerting for critical issues

4. Configure auto-scaling if appropriate.

5. Set up a load balancer for high-availability deployments.

6. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Database Deployment

When deploying database changes:

1. Use database migrations to apply schema changes.

2. Back up the database before applying migrations.

3. Test migrations in a staging environment before production.

4. Schedule database changes during low-traffic periods if possible.

5. Have a rollback plan for database changes.

6. Monitor database performance after changes.

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying the application:

1. Perform smoke tests to verify basic functionality:
   - User authentication
   - Core business functions
   - Critical user journeys

2. Monitor application performance and error rates.

3. Verify that all environment-specific configurations are correct.

4. Check that all external integrations are working properly.

5. Verify that the application is accessible and responsive.

6. Update the Memory Bank with deployment details.

7. Mark the deployment task as completed in the to-do list.

## Rollback Procedures

If issues are discovered after deployment:

1. Assess the severity of the issue to determine if a rollback is necessary.

2. If a rollback is needed:
   - Revert to the previous stable version
   - Restore the database from backup if necessary
   - Verify that the rollback was successful
   - Notify stakeholders of the rollback

3. Document the issue and rollback in the Memory Bank.

4. Develop a fix for the issue and deploy it following the standard deployment process.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

For ongoing monitoring and maintenance:

1. Set up comprehensive monitoring for:
   - Application uptime
   - Error rates
   - Performance metrics
   - Resource utilization
   - Security events

2. Configure alerting for critical issues.

3. Regularly review logs and metrics to identify potential issues.

4. Implement automated health checks.

5. Schedule regular maintenance windows for updates and improvements.

6. Keep dependencies up to date, especially security patches.

Remember to always follow the progressive information flow as described in `core/system_information_flow.md` and check the Memory Bank before taking any action.
