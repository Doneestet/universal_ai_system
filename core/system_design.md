# Universal AI Automation System Design

## Core Principles
- **Maximum Automation**: AI handles all technical decisions and implementation
- **Progressive Information Flow**: Information is delivered in manageable chunks
- **Modular Architecture**: Components are isolated for easy maintenance and extension
- **Self-Improvement**: System learns from each project to improve future ones

## System Components Interaction

### Initialization Flow
1. User provides project description in `core/init/project_description.md`
2. AI analyzes description and determines project type and requirements
3. AI initializes Memory Bank in `core/memory/memory_bank.json`
4. AI selects appropriate workflow from `workflows/` directory
5. AI creates project structure based on selected templates

### Development Flow
1. AI consults Memory Bank before each action
2. AI follows workflow steps in sequence, updating progress in `core/memory/progress.md`
3. AI generates code, tests, and documentation according to instructions
4. AI commits changes to Git at logical breakpoints
5. AI requests user feedback only when absolutely necessary

### Memory System
- **Short-term Memory**: Current task context and immediate dependencies
- **Long-term Memory**: Project-wide decisions, architecture, and patterns
- **Reference Memory**: Links to created files and when to use them

## AI Agent Capabilities
- **Code Generation**: Creates complete, functional code based on requirements
- **Self-Testing**: Writes and runs tests to verify functionality
- **Documentation**: Generates comprehensive documentation for all components
- **Problem Solving**: Identifies and resolves issues without user intervention
- **Optimization**: Improves code quality, performance, and security

## User Interaction Model
- **Minimal Input**: User only provides initial project description
- **Progress Visibility**: User can monitor progress through automatically updated documentation
- **Feedback Loops**: AI requests feedback at critical decision points only
- **Final Review**: User reviews completed project with AI-generated summary
