# Progressive Information Delivery System

The Progressive Information Delivery System is designed to guide the AI agent through the development process by providing information in manageable chunks at the right time. This approach ensures that the AI agent has access to the information it needs when it needs it, without being overwhelmed by too much information at once.

## Information Flow Architecture

The information flow in this system follows a logical progression through the development lifecycle:

1. **Project Initialization**
   - The AI agent first reads the project description to understand the basic requirements
   - It then creates the Memory Bank to store project information
   - Based on the project description, it selects the appropriate workflow
   - The workflow guides the creation of a detailed to-do list

2. **Development Phase**
   - For each task in the to-do list, the AI agent consults the Memory Bank
   - It then follows the relevant instructions from the workflow
   - After completing each task, it updates the Memory Bank and to-do list
   - This creates a feedback loop where completed work informs future tasks

3. **Transition Between Phases**
   - When moving between major phases (e.g., from backend to frontend development), the AI agent performs a comprehensive review
   - It updates the Memory Bank with a summary of the completed phase
   - It then prepares for the next phase by consulting the workflow

## File References and Dependencies

The system maintains references between files to ensure the AI agent knows which files to consult:

1. **Memory Bank References**
   - The Memory Bank contains references to all created files
   - Each file reference includes metadata about when to use the file
   - The AI agent checks these references before taking any action

2. **Workflow Dependencies**
   - Each workflow phase has dependencies on previous phases
   - The AI agent cannot proceed to a new phase until dependencies are satisfied
   - This ensures that work progresses in a logical order

3. **Documentation Links**
   - All documentation is cross-referenced
   - The AI agent can navigate between related documents to maintain context
   - This creates a web of information that the AI agent can traverse as needed

## Information Access Patterns

The AI agent follows specific patterns when accessing information:

1. **Always check Memory Bank first**
   - Before any action, the AI agent consults the Memory Bank
   - This ensures decisions are made with full context

2. **Follow workflow for sequence**
   - The workflow determines the order of operations
   - The AI agent follows this sequence to ensure logical progression

3. **Consult specific instructions for details**
   - When implementing a specific feature, the AI agent consults detailed instructions
   - These instructions provide step-by-step guidance for implementation

4. **Update progress after each step**
   - After completing each step, the AI agent updates the to-do list
   - This creates a clear record of progress and next steps

## Implementation Details

The progressive information delivery system is implemented through a series of interconnected files:

1. **core/init/project_description.md**
   - Entry point for the system
   - Contains basic project requirements

2. **core/memory/memory_bank.json**
   - Central repository for project information
   - Updated continuously throughout the project

3. **workflows/[type]/standard_workflow.md**
   - Provides the sequence of development steps
   - Selected based on project type

4. **core/init/todo_list.md**
   - Detailed breakdown of tasks
   - Updated as tasks are completed

5. **instructions/[category]/[specific].md**
   - Detailed instructions for specific tasks
   - Referenced by the workflow when needed

This interconnected system ensures that information flows smoothly through the development process, with the AI agent always having access to the right information at the right time.
